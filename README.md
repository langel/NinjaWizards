============

simple php libraries for miscellaneous tasks

image - manipulate and convert

mp3 - handles tags and reads meta data
...currently doesn't handle lame encoded mp3's very well

smtp - send teh mails
...I suspect it hardly works, and currently is hard coded to send using gmail

zip - utilizes *nix command line
...could be optimized to not move files around first
